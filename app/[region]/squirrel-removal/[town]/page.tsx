    headline: `Professional Squirrel Removal in Suffolk County, NY`,
    body: `Suffolk County's abundant woodland corridors and mature residential trees sustain large squirrel populations throughout the county's townships. Homes in Smithtown, Huntington, Babylon, and Islip regularly face squirrel intrusions through weathered wood soffits, ridge vents, and gaps at chimney bases. Wooded lots near nature preserves and open space experience the highest intrusion rates, as squirrel populations are dense and territorial disputes push individuals to seek alternate den sites. Our Suffolk County squirrel removal team provides thorough exclusion work — inspection, one-way door installation, permanent sealing, and optional attic remediation. We serve all of Suffolk County's townships and villages with same-day inspection availability.`,
    faqs: [
      { q: 'What time of year are squirrels most active in Suffolk County attics?', a: 'Peak nesting periods in Suffolk County are late January through March and August through October. These are the seasons when squirrel intrusions into attics are most commonly reported.' },
      { q: 'Can squirrels damage insulation in a Suffolk County home?', a: 'Yes. Squirrels use attic insulation as nesting material, compressing and redistributing it in ways that reduce R-value and energy efficiency. They also urinate and defecate in insulation, which may require replacement.' },
      { q: 'Do you handle flying squirrels in Suffolk County?', a: 'Yes. Flying squirrels are nocturnal and often go undetected longer than gray squirrels. They\'re common in wooded Suffolk County areas and are handled with the same humane exclusion methods.' },
    ],

  nassau: {
    headline: `Professional Squirrel Removal in Nassau County, NY`,
    body: `Nassau County's mature suburban neighborhoods — with their dense canopy of oak, maple, and beech trees — support thriving gray squirrel populations that frequently attempt attic entry. Homes in Great Neck, Manhasset, Oyster Bay, and throughout the county deal with squirrel intrusions that cause structural damage and create fire hazards from chewed wiring. Our Nassau County squirrel removal specialists are experts in residential exclusion, identifying every gap in your roofline and attic perimeter and sealing each one with gnaw-proof materials after one-way doors allow the animals to leave safely. We also offer attic insulation inspection and replacement if nesting debris has contaminated your attic. Guaranteed results throughout Nassau County.`,
    faqs: [
      { q: 'How do I know if I have squirrels in my Nassau County attic?', a: 'Signs include rapid light scurrying sounds in the morning and afternoon, visible damage to soffit or fascia boards, and droppings in attic insulation. You may also see squirrels actively entering or exiting near the roofline.' },
      { q: 'Will squirrels chew through the roof to enter a Nassau County home?', a: 'Squirrels don\'t typically chew through solid roofing material, but they will aggressively enlarge existing gaps in wood fascia, soffit, and ridge venting. Preventive inspections before nesting season are the best defense.' },
      { q: 'Is squirrel exclusion guaranteed in Nassau County?', a: 'Yes. We back all exclusion work in Nassau County with a written guarantee. If a squirrel re-enters through a point we sealed, we return and correct the issue at no additional charge.' },
    ],
  },
  queens: {
    headline: `Professional Squirrel Removal in Queens, NY`,
    body: `Queens' mature street trees and residential neighborhoods provide squirrels with abundant food and nesting sites — including the attics of homes throughout Bayside, Fresh Meadows, Forest Hills, and Flushing. Squirrels are most likely to attempt entry in late winter and early spring when females seek warm, protected nesting sites for their litters. Once established in an attic, a squirrel family can be heard scrambling and gnawing at all hours. Our Queens squirrel removal specialists perform full exterior inspections to identify all entry points, install one-way exclusion doors, and seal the attic permanently after the animals have left. We also repair damaged soffit, fascia, and ridge venting as part of our exclusion service. Call us for fast, humane squirrel removal throughout Queens.`,
    faqs: [
      { q: 'When do squirrels try to enter Queens homes?', a: 'Squirrel intrusion peaks twice a year in Queens — late winter/early spring (January–March) when females give birth, and late summer/fall (August–October) when young squirrels disperse and look for winter den sites.' },
      { q: 'What noises do squirrels make in Queens attics?', a: 'Squirrels in attics make quick, light scurrying sounds — typically in early morning and late afternoon when they\'re most active. You may also hear rolling sounds (nuts being moved), and loud gnawing.' },
      { q: 'Do you repair squirrel damage to Queens roofs and soffit?', a: 'Yes. Our exclusion service includes repair of damaged entry points. We use galvanized steel mesh, flashing, and sealed caulk to prevent re-entry, and can replace damaged wood fascia and soffit panels.' },
